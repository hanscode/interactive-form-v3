### Project 3: Interactive Form
Author - Hans Steffens

## Project Overview
In this project, I'll use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

## Features
Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I'll add JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

- Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity.
- Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
